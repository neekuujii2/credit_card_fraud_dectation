# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Overview

Credit card fraud is a prevalent issue affecting financial institutions and customers worldwide. This project aims to develop a robust fraud detection system using machine learning techniques to identify fraudulent transactions and prevent unauthorized charges to customers' accounts.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. Key aspects of the dataset include:

- **Timeframe:** Transactions occurred over a span of two days.
- **Class Imbalance:** The dataset is highly unbalanced, with fraudulent transactions accounting for only 0.172% of all transactions.
- **Features:** The dataset contains only numerical input variables resulting from a PCA transformation. The original features and background information are not provided due to confidentiality reasons.
- **Principal Components:** Features V1 through V28 represent the principal components obtained with PCA. Features 'Time' and 'Amount' are not transformed and represent the time elapsed between transactions and the transaction amount, respectively.
- **Response Variable:** The 'Class' feature denotes the transaction's class, taking the value 1 in case of fraud and 0 otherwise.

Given the class imbalance ratio, accuracy is not an appropriate metric for evaluation. The Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC) is recommended for assessing model performance.
